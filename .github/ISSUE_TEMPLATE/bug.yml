        If applicable, please provide a self-contained,
        [minimal, reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)
        demonstrating the bug.

        If possible, your example should be a single-file script. Instead of `.run()`-ing an MCP server, use a `Client` to directly interact with it (`async with Client(mcp) as client: ...`) and demonstrate the issue.

        from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client

        mcp = FastMCP()

        async with Client(mcp) as client:
            ...

        To get this information, run the following command in your terminal and paste the output below:

        ```bash
        fastmcp version
        ```

        If there is other information that would be helpful, please include it as well.
