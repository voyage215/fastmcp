<VersionBadge version="2.2.0" />

As your MCP applications grow, you might want to organize your tools, resources, and prompts into logical modules or reuse existing server components. FastMCP supports composition through two methods:

- **`import_server`**: For a one-time copy of components with prefixing (static composition).
- **`mount`**: For creating a live link where the main server delegates requests to the subserver (dynamic composition).

## Why Compose Servers?

-   **Modularity**: Break down large applications into smaller, focused servers (e.g., a `WeatherServer`, a `DatabaseServer`, a `CalendarServer`).
-   **Reusability**: Create common utility servers (e.g., a `TextProcessingServer`) and mount them wherever needed.
-   **Teamwork**: Different teams can work on separate FastMCP servers that are later combined.
-   **Organization**: Keep related functionality grouped together logically.

### Importing vs Mounting

The choice of importing or mounting depends on your use case and requirements.

| Feature | Importing | Mounting |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Method** | `FastMCP.import_server()` | `FastMCP.mount()` |
| **Composition Type** | One-time copy (static) | Live link (dynamic) |
| **Updates** | Changes to subserver NOT reflected | Changes to subserver immediately reflected |
| **Best For** | Bundling finalized components | Modular runtime composition |

### Proxy Servers

FastMCP supports [MCP proxying](/patterns/proxy), which allows you to mirror a local or remote server in a local FastMCP instance. Proxies are fully compatible with both importing and mounting.

## Importing (Static Composition)

The `import_server()` method copies all components (tools, resources, templates, prompts) from one `FastMCP` instance (the *subserver*) into another (the *main server*). A `prefix` is added to avoid naming conflicts.

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
import asyncio

# Define subservers
weather_mcp = FastMCP(name="WeatherService")

@weather_mcp.tool()
def get_forecast(city: str) -> dict:
    """Get weather forecast."""
    return {"city": city, "forecast": "Sunny"}

@weather_mcp.resource("data://cities/supported")
def list_supported_cities() -> list[str]:
    """List cities with weather support."""
    return ["London", "Paris", "Tokyo"]

# Define main server
main_mcp = FastMCP(name="MainApp")

# Import subserver
async def setup():
    await main_mcp.import_server("weather", weather_mcp)

# Result: main_mcp now contains prefixed components:
# - Tool: "weather_get_forecast"
# - Resource: "weather+data://cities/supported" 

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(setup())
    main_mcp.run()
```

### How Importing Works

When you call `await main_mcp.import_server(prefix, subserver)`:

1.  **Tools**: All tools from `subserver` are added to `main_mcp` with names prefixed using `{prefix}_`.
    -   `subserver.tool(name="my_tool")` becomes `main_mcp.tool(name="{prefix}_my_tool")`.
2.  **Resources**: All resources are added with URIs prefixed using `{prefix}+`.
    -   `subserver.resource(uri="data://info")` becomes `main_mcp.resource(uri="{prefix}+data://info")`.
3.  **Resource Templates**: Templates are prefixed similarly to resources.
    -   `subserver.resource(uri="data://{id}")` becomes `main_mcp.resource(uri="{prefix}+data://{id}")`.
4.  **Prompts**: All prompts are added with names prefixed like tools.
    -   `subserver.prompt(name="my_prompt")` becomes `main_mcp.prompt(name="{prefix}_my_prompt")`.

Note that `import_server` performs a **one-time copy** of components. Changes made to the `subserver` *after* importing **will not** be reflected in `main_mcp`. The `subserver`'s `lifespan` context is also **not** executed by the main server.

## Mounting (Live Linking)

The `mount()` method creates a **live link** between the `main_mcp` server and the `subserver`. Instead of copying components, requests for components matching the `prefix` are **delegated** to the `subserver` at runtime.

```python
import asyncio
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client

# Define subserver
dynamic_mcp = FastMCP(name="DynamicService")

@dynamic_mcp.tool()
def initial_tool():
    """Initial tool demonstration."""
    return "Initial Tool Exists"

# Mount subserver (synchronous operation)
main_mcp = FastMCP(name="MainAppLive")
main_mcp.mount("dynamic", dynamic_mcp)

# Add a tool AFTER mounting - it will be accessible through main_mcp
@dynamic_mcp.tool()
def added_later():
    """Tool added after mounting."""
    return "Tool Added Dynamically!"

# Testing access to mounted tools
async def test_dynamic_mount():
    tools = await main_mcp.get_tools()
    print("Available tools:", list(tools.keys()))
    # Shows: ['dynamic_initial_tool', 'dynamic_added_later']
    
    async with Client(main_mcp) as client:
        result = await client.call_tool("dynamic_added_later")
        print("Result:", result[0].text)
        # Shows: "Tool Added Dynamically!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(test_dynamic_mount())
```

### How Mounting Works

When mounting is configured:

1. **Live Link**: The parent server establishes a connection to the mounted server.
2. **Dynamic Updates**: Changes to the mounted server are immediately reflected when accessed through the parent.
3. **Prefixed Access**: The parent server uses prefixes to route requests to the mounted server.
4. **Delegation**: Requests for components matching the prefix are delegated to the mounted server at runtime.

The same prefixing rules apply as with `import_server` for naming tools, resources, templates, and prompts.

### Direct vs. Proxy Mounting

<VersionBadge version="2.2.7" />

FastMCP supports two mounting modes:

1. **Direct Mounting** (default): The parent server directly accesses the mounted server's objects in memory.
   - No client lifecycle events occur on the mounted server
   - The mounted server's lifespan context is not executed
   - Communication is handled through direct method calls
   
2. **Proxy Mounting**: The parent server treats the mounted server as a separate entity and communicates with it through a client interface.
   - Full client lifecycle events occur on the mounted server
   - The mounted server's lifespan is executed when a client connects
   - Communication happens via an in-memory Client transport

```python
# Direct mounting (default when no custom lifespan)
main_mcp.mount("api", api_server)

# Proxy mounting (preserves full client lifecycle)
main_mcp.mount("api", api_server, as_proxy=True)
```

FastMCP automatically uses proxy mounting when the mounted server has a custom lifespan, but you can override this behavior with the `as_proxy` parameter.

#### Interaction with Proxy Servers

When using `FastMCP.from_client()` to create a proxy server, mounting that server will always use proxy mounting:

```python
# Create a proxy for a remote server
remote_proxy = FastMCP.from_client(Client("http://example.com/mcp"))

# Mount the proxy (always uses proxy mounting)
main_server.mount("remote", remote_proxy)
```

## Customizing Separators

Both `import_server()` and `mount()` allow you to customize the separators used for prefixing components. The defaults are `_` for tools and prompts, and `+` for resources.

<CodeGroup>

```python import_server
await main_mcp.import_server(
    prefix="api",
    app=some_subserver,
    tool_separator="_",       # Tool name becomes: "api_sub_tool_name"
    resource_separator="+",   # Resource URI becomes: "api+data://sub_resource"
    prompt_separator="_"      # Prompt name becomes: "api_sub_prompt_name"
)
```

```python mount
main_mcp.mount(
    prefix="api",
    app=some_subserver,
    tool_separator="_",       # Tool name becomes: "api_sub_tool_name"
    resource_separator="+",   # Resource URI becomes: "api+data://sub_resource"
    prompt_separator="_"      # Prompt name becomes: "api_sub_prompt_name"
)
```
</CodeGroup>
<Warning>
Be cautious when choosing separators. Some MCP clients (like Claude Desktop) might have restrictions on characters allowed in tool names (e.g., `/` might not be supported). The defaults (`_` for names, `+` for URIs) are generally safe.
</Warning>

<Tip>
To "cleanly" import or mount a server, set the prefix and all separators to `""` (empty string). This is generally unecessary but could save a couple tokens at the risk of a name collision!
