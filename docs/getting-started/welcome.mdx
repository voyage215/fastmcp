The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) is a new, standardized way to provide context and tools to your LLMs, and FastMCP makes building MCP servers and clients simple and intuitive. Create tools, expose resources, define prompts, and more with clean, Pythonic code:

```python {1, 3, 5, 11}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Demo 🚀")

@mcp.tool()
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers"""
    return a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```


## FastMCP 2.0 and the Official MCP SDK

<Tip>
Recognize the `FastMCP` name? You might have seen the version that was contributed to the [official MCP Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk), which was based on **FastMCP 1.0**.


**Welcome to FastMCP 2.0!** This is the [actively developed successor](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp), and it significantly expands on 1.0 by introducing powerful client capabilities, server proxying & composition, OpenAPI/FastAPI integration, and more advanced features.

FastMCP 2.0 is the recommended path for building modern, powerful MCP applications. Ready to upgrade or get started? Follow the [installation instructions](/getting-started/installation), which include specific steps for upgrading.

## What is MCP?
The Model Context Protocol lets you build servers that expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. It is often described as "the USB-C port for AI", providing a uniform way to connect LLMs to resources they can use. It may be easier to think of it as an API, but specifically designed for LLM interactions. MCP servers can:

- Expose data through `Resources` (think of these sort of like GET endpoints; they are used to load information into the LLM's context)
- Provide functionality through `Tools` (sort of like POST endpoints; they are used to execute code or otherwise produce a side effect)
- Define interaction patterns through `Prompts` (reusable templates for LLM interactions)
- And more!

There is a low-level Python SDK available for implementing the protocol directly, but FastMCP aims to make that easier by providing a high-level, Pythonic interface.


## Why FastMCP?

The MCP protocol is powerful but implementing it involves a lot of boilerplate - server setup, protocol handlers, content types, error management. FastMCP handles all the complex protocol details and server management, so you can focus on building great tools. It's designed to be high-level and Pythonic; in most cases, decorating a function is all you need.

While the core server concepts of FastMCP 1.0 laid the groundwork and were contributed to the official MCP SDK, FastMCP 2.0 (this project) is the actively developed successor, adding significant enhancements and entirely new capabilities like a powerful client library, server proxying, composition patterns, and much more.

FastMCP aims to be:

🚀 **Fast**: High-level interface means less code and faster development

🍀 **Simple**: Build MCP servers with minimal boilerplate

🐍 **Pythonic**: Feels natural to Python developers

🔍 **Complete**: FastMCP aims to provide a full implementation of the core MCP specification


## `llms.txt`

This documentation is also available in [llms.txt format](https://llmstxt.org/), which is a simple markdown standard that LLMs can consume easily. 

There are two ways to access the LLM-friendly documentation:
- [`llms.txt`](https://gofastmcp.com/llms.txt) is essentially a sitemap, listing all the pages in the documentation.
- [`llms-full.txt`](https://gofastmcp.com/llms-full.txt) contains the entire documentation. Note this may exceed the context window of your LLM.
